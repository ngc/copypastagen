It might take me a while because I have to keep pausing this manifesto to stroke. But here it is: I am *fully* addicted to stroking my dick. I squirt my nut at least 3 times a day, but I\u2019m working on getting better at edging. I can\u2019t help it. At work, I\u2019m more or less a normal guy. Except I\u2019m thinking about how long I\u2019m going to masturbate when I get home. I work retail, so it\u2019s a lot of walking and squatting. All day I feel my underwear on my body. My jeans. Whether it\u2019s my silky boxers or my old cotton briefs. All day I just feel my dick rolling around down there, fabric pressing up against my taint and my asshole. Rubbing on my ass. When I take a piss break, my meat rolls out of my drawers and I smell my bate from the night before. The whole bathroom just gets permeated with that salty cock smell. The old cum. Drops of piss. God it gets me horny. I look down and admire my cock as the piss rushes out.  Then I finally get home. I rush to the bathroom and strip down and get the shower running. Half the time I don\u2019t even really shower, I just sort of absentmindedly pull my pud until I figure I\u2019ve stood under the water long enough. After I get out, I eat a quick meal while I paw at my bulge through my shorts. And then the real fun begins. I get totally naked. Or just pull my shorts down around my ankles. Pull up some videos of other dudes masturbating. Run my fingers through my pits, my pubes, all over my taint. Then I bring them up to my nose. The scent of my own skunky pits and musky taint is intoxicating. I look at my penis. I tell my penis I love it. I watch other dudes fall in love with their dicks. He becomes his penis. I become mine. I become him and he becomes me. That\u2019s the nature of the brotherhood, dudes. When I put my hand on my penis, I can feel your hand on your penis. And my asshole clenches and releases again and again. And my balls bounce around. My taint gets tight. And my whole body becomes pleasure I fucking love my penis. I love my penis. Penis penis penis.

The process begins by scourging the Eurasian Steppes for a specific type of silicon ore. The name of this material is too complex to be translated to English, and I fear that if I told you the name, it would be lethally ravaging to your feeble virgin mind. But for the sake of reference, we will roughly translate this material to \u201cKhamag Yurmumgei.\u201d Once Yurmumgei is acquired, the material must be transported to the blacksmith and forged within 32 hours, otherwise the material will begin leaking corruption which will ultimately result in the demise of the multiverse. After delivering the Yurmumgei, he who had delivered it must immediately commit suicide. Otherwise the ore will begin to gain malevolent sentience and start attacking everyone in the vicinity. It is said that by commiting suicide, the spirit leaves the corpse and is then consumed by the Yurmumgei ore, leaving it content and willing to be smelted. Once smelted, it can freely be forged as one pleases. For my motherboard, a Chinese sweatshop laborer volunteered to mine Yurmumgei ore for the sweet release of death. That\u2019s right, someone died for my motherboard. He probably had more worth than you. That\u2019s how expensive it is.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fsca46/oop_is_trash_a_programming_language_copy_pasta/"}, {"title": "The Main Characters in Spongebob are Marxist Symbols", "content": "We start with Mr. Krabs, who is obviously the Bourgeois business owner who ruthlessly exploits Squidward and Spongebob. There is no question about this, it is repeatedly demonstrated that Mr. Krabs is a cruel boss, pathetically obsessed with money even at the expense of his own health (\u201cSquid's Day Off\u201d). He has attempted to charge his workers for breathing (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d), forced them to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (\u201cGraveyard Shift\u201d) and even traded Spongebob's soul for a measly 62 cents (\u201cBorn Again Krabs\u201d). His continual protection of the Krabby Patty Secret Formula from Plankton, in which he enlists the involuntary help of Spongebob (who sees it as a valiant quest to protect the honor of the Krusty Krab) and Squidward (who is just in it for the paycheck), is nothing more than a cheap quest to protect the profit margin of the Krabby Patty, which he likely sells for more than it is worth. There are two ways his workers can react to this awful situation, and Spongebob and Squidward each represent one of them. Squidward is the class-conscious worker. He is fully aware of his miserable situation under the thumb of Mr. Krabs, thus resulting in his depressed and irritable attitude. He is clearly no stranger to Marxist ideas, being the only one of the two to quit due to Krabs' abuse (\u201cCan You Spare a Dime?\u201d) and starting a strike against Mr. Krabs (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d). He finds solace in art, and dreams of living in a utopian Fully Automated Luxury Communism, relaxing while making his art and sharing it with the world. It was Oscar Wilde, after all, who argued in The Soul of Man Under Socialism that only when their needs are fully accounted for can the artist truly hone their creative genius. He is continually disappointed with his fellow proletarians, the denizens of Bikini Bottom, most of all Spongebob.\n\nIf one thinks about it, Squidward really has no apparent reason to hate Spongebob. Spongebob is incredibly kind to Squidward, giving him gifts, saying good morning to him every day, altogether just trying to bring joy into Squidward's life. We are led to believe that Squidward is simply a curmudgeon who hates Spongebob for being happy while he is depressed. But is that really as deep as it goes? I think not. Once one realizes the Marxist undertones in Spongebob, the answer is clear: Squidward resents Spongebob because he is not class-conscious.\n\nDespite his miserable working conditions, despite his boss's abusive behavior, Spongebob remains relentlessly optimistic. A classic case of the unconscious worker. He is cheerful and optimistic about his condition because he is unaware of anything beyond it. He has a Stockholm Syndrome-esque relationship with his boss, seeing him as a father figure (a classic symptom of blind obedience to authority) and enduring humiliating treatment because he holds on to the promise of one day owning the Krusty Krab, thus taking Krabs' place as the new Bourgeois. Given that he does not even know what a Strike is (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d) it is clear that he has never been exposed to the Marxist critique. In this context, Squidward represents the ill fate of the worker who does not respect his fellow worker. His attempt at revolution fails because he does not respect Spongebob, and simply tried to use him as a pawn for his own ends. But I digress.\n\nPatrick represents what Marx called the Lumpenproletariat. Unemployed, he is left out of the class struggle, and even if he were involved in it would be too stupid to do anything, as symbolized in his attempt at employment in \u201cBig Pink Loser\u201d. However his value to Squidward, the class-conscious worker who hopes for revolution, is underrated. Marxists from Bakunin onward have criticized Marx's rejection of the lumpenproletariat, and Stephen Hillenburg is no exception. Patrick clearly has the socialist spirit in him, recognizing the value of idleness and enjoying life's simple pleasures. Patrick never seeks after money or power as the Bourgeois expects him to, he simply wants to live out his life in peace. He values friendship over all things; he once admitted to spending all day waiting for his best friend, Spongebob, to come back (\u201cNew Student Starfish\u201d). Could this represent how industrial work gets in the way of social bonds? Possibly. The point, my friend, is that Patrick in his idle lumpen state has captured the same optimism and joie de vivre of Spongebob. It could be said that the only difference between him and Spongebob is that Spongebob has subsumed to industrial work. In this way, he is the proletarian who is conscious of Socialist ideas without even knowing it.\n\nSandy and Plankton represent two possibilities of the future in Marxist analysis. Both of them are clearly college-educated scientists whose approach to technology differs based on their position towards Capitalism. Plankton represents the dystopian Capitalist future, the future of Cyberspace where companies like the Chum Bucket control society (remember that Plankton's expressed goal is to \u201ctake over the world\u201d). He represents a cold, distant, inhuman, industrial future, as symbolized by the cold metal interior of the Chum Bucket.\n\nSandy, on the other hand, seems as well-versed in technology as Plankton, but has used it for a completely different purpose. She has created the treedome, an ecological, self-sustaining utopia in which she has everything she needs. She built a rocket to the moon for the sole purpose of exploration (\u201cSandy's Rocket\u201d). She pursues science out of pure wonder and a desire for the fulfillment of knowledge, unlike Plankton who pursues science out of a desire for domination and control. She represents Fully Automated Luxury Communism, a utopia in which everyone has everything they need and are free to pursue their passions without the burden of work.\n\nFinally, we have Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff was a hard one, but I think she represents the failure and uselessness of modern education. She continually attempts to teach Spongebob a useless skill (he walks to work, he doesn't need to drive) for a pathetic trinket of authority (his driver's license, whose possibility of attainment he worships).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fsggc0/the_main_characters_in_spongebob_are_marxist/"}, {"title": "You chose INTEL OVER AMD?!?", "content": "YOU SERIOUSLY CHOSE INTEL OVER AMD?\n\nYou idiot.

My heartbeat is still all erratic from it. I had a boner the size of Manhattan the entire time. She's sleeping now and I guess she feels better because she stopped coughing. Details: She's about 5 feet tall, has long brown hair, a cute face, a thin waist and long skinny legs. She's in jammies I think because although I'm pretty shaken up right now I know I unbuttoned something before I went at it. God I feel so great. I just rubbed my hands all over her FUCKING TITS, you guys. Well the puffy parts of her chest anyway. Her nipples got hard. I just about wept tears of joy.

Business has been booming, apparently; as Vic watches, a huge crowd of women leave together, all laughing and waving goodbye to each other as if they just did something enjoyable.\n\nVic looks away. These women aren\u2019t who he\u2019s been waiting for.\n\nCompulsively, he unlocks his phone to look at the screenshot again. He doesn\u2019t know why he keeps pulling the image back up again, when he knows all it\u2019s going to do is make his stomach clench with what he assumes must be anger, but he\u2019s never been great at impulse control.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple picture: just a man, arms crossed and smiling, standing in front of a flag. Except it\u2019s not simple at all, because the flag is rainbow, and the man is Stu.\n\nVic had almost choked on his bagel that morning when the ad first popped onto his phone. He wouldn\u2019t have been shocked to learn that Stu was gay (he\u2019d certainly spent enough time lecturing Vic on getting in touch with his emotions), but he wasn\u2019t just gay\u2013\u2013he was gay and dating Vic\u2019s daughter. That\u2019s a pretty bold move for someone who had, less than a year prior, witnessed Vic murder numerous people.\n\nFollowing a brief phone call with Nicole (a phone call that had ended with Nicole saying \u201cDad, it\u2019s not what you\u2013\u2013\u201d and Vic hanging up to pay closer attention to the blood pounding in his ears), he had gathered some intel (downloaded Instagram, watched the Spinster account story) and used his keen investigative abilities to ascertain that a board meeting was being held the following afternoon. Which is how he finds himself here, seething on a sidewalk bench, waiting for Stu to leave the building so Vic can kill him.\n\nThe front door swings open again. Vic leans forward, squinting. Bingo.\n\nStu looks healthier these days. Probably healthier than Vic has seen him since the first time they met, back before Stu had ever been hit in the face with a handgun, or held as a hostage, or had been in a car collision with violent criminals. Vic has never done him much good. He pulls his hood over his face and unlocks his phone again. Why start now.\n\nIt\u2019s too fucking easy, Vic thinks as he clicks Request Uber from the fake account he had made that morning . Nothing to it but timing and patience. He watches from across the way as Stu pauses, pulls out his phone, and gets into his car (a new one, obviously; white Corolla, ugly as hell, definitely neither silent nor deadly this time, but Stu must\u2019ve had second thoughts about the wisdom of leasing).\n\nMoments later Stu is pulling his ugly ass car around the corner, stopping where GPS tells him like a good boy. Vic pulls open the door and gets in the back.\n\nThis was the moment he thought might be tricky. Stu is so aggressively hospitable, Vic has assumed there\u2019d be no way he\u2019d be able to get into the car without immediately blowing his cover. But Stu just mutters \u201cMake yourself comfortable,\u201d and pulls away, not even looking at Vic, much less offering him imported chocolate.\n\nThey drive in silence. Vic leans back, staring a hole through the back of Stu\u2019s head and breathing heavily, trying not to be disturbed by Stu\u2019s remarkably sedated demeanor. He\u2019s set his destination to an abandoned lot, shielded by development on all sides. Should be quiet on a Sunday afternoon. Vic almost has to smile at that. God\u2019s day.\n\nAs they approach the destination he can feels Stu starting to get confused, craning forward to look at the desolate lot.\n\n\u201cYou sure this is where you want?\u201d Stu asks, breaking the silence at last. \u201cGotta say, not the most bumping spot in L.A.\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Vic says.\n\nStu visibly freezes. He brakes the car abruptly in the middle of the lot and raises his eyes, slowly, to the rearview mirror.\n\nTheir eyes connect in the reflection. It\u2019s been awhile, Vic realizes, since he last made eye contact with someone.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Stu squawks. \u201cVic, no! I will not go on a killing spree again! Do not ask me!\u201d\n\nVic growls low in his throat and reaches around the seat to grab a fistful of Stu\u2019s shirt. \u201cShut the frick up. You and I need to talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a phone!\u201d Stu is twisting against Vic\u2019s grip. \u201cCall me on my phone! We\u2019ve been over this! Kidnapping people is not nice!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to explain something to me,\u201d Vic says, pulling Stu forward so he\u2019s forced to twist around and face the backseat. \u201cExplain it real nice and simple, and maybe we\u2019ll get out of here without losing any more teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why the threats,\u201d Stu says weakly. \u201cThere are better ways\u2026\u201d\n\nVic grapples clumsily with one hand to retrieve his phone, shoving it at Stu\u2019s face. \u201cThis,\u201d he hisses. \u201cTell me what I\u2019m looking at, Stuber.\u201d\n\nStu blinks at it. \u201cUh. A neoliberal marketing campaign?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that in the picture? Tell me my eyes aren\u2019t shot to shit, Stu. Tell me I know who this is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d says Stu, \u201cwould be me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s real funny.\u201d Vic barks a flavorless laugh. \u201cFunny \u2018cause, see, I thought you were dating my daughter.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding crosses Stu\u2019s face. He groans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Vic releases his shirt roughly. \u201cSo explain it to me. What exactly am I missing here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not my place to\u2013\u2013\u201d Vic lunges forward again, and Stu throws his hands up by his face. \u201cAll right, all right! My god! Calm down for two minutes. We were never really dating.\u201d\n\nThat does make Vic pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, dude.\u201d Stu is fixing his shirt nervously, moving with obviously jitteriness. \u201cHave you seen your daughter? You think the only person she can bag is her dad\u2019s kidnapped Uber driver? She\u2019s good. I\u2019m the one you should be worried about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clicking. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Vic frowns, rubs his forehead with his hands.\n\n\u201cShe thought it\u2019d be funny, man. I don\u2019t know. You know I\u2019m a pushover. We were talking about commissioning something from her for the studio, get a little culture in there\u2013\u2013she said she\u2019d cut us a deal if I pretended to be her boyfriend. Said you were always so overprotective, that you\u2019d freak out. Gotta say, I wouldn't have agreed if I knew she meant freaking out like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus.\u201d Vic is shocked for one beat, and then he laughs out loud. \u201cThat little scamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, I don\u2019t get why you couldn\u2019t have thought that little scamp around the time you were deciding to come knock my teeth in,\u201d Stu tells him. \u201cSerious double standard there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo...what\u2019s the deal with...\u201d Vic brandishes his phone, still not sure what to call it.\n\n\u201cDeal?\u201d Stu shrugs. \u201cNo deal. They were looking for volunteers. Showcasing diversity, that was the phrase. I figured there\u2019s no harm in getting my face out there\u2026\u201d He frowns, refocusing on Vic. \u201cBut what, you were coming to knock some sense into me? After everything we\u2019ve been through? Seriously, I thought we\u2019d made some kind of breakthrough.\u201d\n\nThis is not going the way Vic had anticipated, and he\u2019s feeling confused. The memory of whatever it was he had planned to do is getting fuzzier and fuzzier.\n\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Stu is saying. \u201cYou got yourself so worked up, you decided to hurtle after me without thinking anything through. Sorry if this is a sensitive subject, but thank God you lost your job, you do not have the temperament of someone who should be allowed to pull guns on civilians.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Vic closes his eyes for a moment, processing. \u201cAnd who does have that temperament, in your opinion?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no one. But definitely not you. Definitely not me, either. That\u2019s at least one thing we have in common.\u201d\n\nTo his own surprise, Vic laughs. He opens his eyes again and looks at Stu, who is watching him warily from the front seat. Suddenly Vic is thinking about the tension in his stomach, about the overwhelming impulse to once again command Stu\u2019s attention. It does feel strangely, powerfully good to see him.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Stu says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Vic.\n\nStu stares at him. Vic supposes he can\u2019t blame him for that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t have the temperament. Thought I did for years. But I dragged you along with me, put you in all kinds of danger, and then tried to scare you again.\u201d Vic looks out the window into the empty lot. He isn\u2019t used to this. \u201cGuess I still have a lot of personal work to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Stu still sounds cautious, like he might be walking into a new trap. \u201cIf you can recognize it, that\u2019s very healthy.\u201d\n\nVic thinks he\u2019s beginning to recognize something else. How many times had he ignored Stu\u2019s objections and insisted they remain a team? Any Uber driver could have driven him through L.A.; probably plenty of them would have ended the night without using a golf club to beat him black and blue. Even then, he hadn\u2019t wanted to relinquish Stu, not for a second.\n\nWhen he looks at Stu, Vic realizes with a shiver, he feels possessive.\n\nVic turns back to Stu and sees that he has been watching his face carefully. And there it goes again. Impulse control.\n\n\u201cYou wanna come back here?\u201d Vic asks.\n\nHe is stunned to see, written all across Stu\u2019s face, that the answer is yes.\n\nBut Stu can never just go with the obvious thing. He inhales sharply, turns back to face the front, and grips the steering wheel as if to steady himself. \u201cDoes that seem smart to you?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be brave than smart,\u201d Vic says.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly your problem,\u201d Stu tells him.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s yours.\"\n\nStu twitches, grinds the heel of his palm into his forehead. Then, with such sudden movement Vic almost jumps, he spins around in his seat, grabbing the headrest to propel himself, and climbs over the center console into Vic\u2019s lap.\n\nVic lets out another growl and grabs the back of Stu\u2019s thighs, pulling him closer. Stu reaches up and grabs Vic\u2019s face with both hands, pulling him in, kissing him feverishly.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Stu says when he breaks away, \u201cis not smart, this is stupid, do not take this to mean I approve of\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease shut up,\u201d Vic says, and Stu obeys long enough to latch his mouth onto the side of Vic\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cStupid,\u201d he says again when he breaks away, but he isn\u2019t stopping. Instead he moves his knee to push it between Vic\u2019s legs, and that\u2019s a surprise, somehow; Vic drops his head back and releases a noise from somewhere beyond his control.\n\nStu is on him with power and confidence that Vic never would have imagined. He pushes Vic\u2019s shirt up and over his head with one hand, tossing it onto the car floor.\n\nVic is spaced out, borderline delirious. He can\u2019t think of the last time someone moved him around the way Stu is doing now, fumbling with his jeans in the confined space and pushing his hand in to palm Vic through his shorts.\n\n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Stu asks, always so good, so courteous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all okay,\u201d Vic says. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna\u2013\u2013all of it, it\u2019s all okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stu says it like he\u2019s talking to himself, recommitting to the action. \u201cOkay.\u201d He pulls his hand out of Vic\u2019s jeans and grabs them by the belt loops, helping Vic shimmy out of them. Then Stu puts his hand against Vic\u2019s shoulder and pushes him to lie down. Vic goes.\n\nAbove him, Stu losing his shirt, ripping off his shoes and unbuttoning his pants. This is unreality, but Vic likes it.\n\n\u201cHold on, I\u2019ve got\u2026\u201d Stu leans back across the console, popping open the glove compartment and rustling through it. He comes back victorious, holding up a miniature bottle.\n\nVic laughs out loud. \u201cJesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for the things people leave in my car,\u201d Stu says, grinning too, leaning back over Vic and popping the bottle open. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what this baby\u2019s stashed with. Mace, two pocket knives, a very expensive looking bracelet..\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Vic says. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d\n\nBut Stu just looks at him, his eyes skimming Vic\u2019s body laid out before him, taking it in. \u201cYou sure this is good? I mean, it\u2019s a pretty major turnaround from the last time I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always sure,\u201d Vic says. He\u2019s impatient, feeling that hunger, that aching. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stu says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it now. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not gonna talk about it at all.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s good enough, because then Vic can feel Stu\u2019s hand on his thigh, pushing it up until Vic takes the hint and pulls his knees toward his chest.\n\nHe\u2019s hanging half off the seat, and every time he moves he can feel the faded leather seat sticking to his skin; but more important is the feeling of Stu pressing into him, making everything else hazy around the edges.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says out loud, because he knows Stu needs the encouragement; and then, sooner than he knows is really smart, but they\u2019ve established being smart isn\u2019t first priority, \u201cMore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s gotta be a sign of trust that Stu doesn\u2019t question him, just pulls his hand away and leans down. He puts a hand to the side of Vic\u2019s face, mutters Okay one more time, and pushes forward.\n\nOn the first thrust their foreheads bump. Stu\u2019s eyes flutter closed and he lets out a gasp. Vic turns his head to the side, breathing heavily, trying not to acknowledge that his legs are already wrapped firmly around Stu\u2019s waist. He\u2019s loved this from the first time; that suddenly burning need, and then its full satisfaction, the feeling of wholeness.\n\nStu is driving into him and Vic is moaning, pitiful really, but what\u2019s he supposed to do with Stu on top of him; nothing in the world but weight and feeling and the salty taste of skin when Vic opens his mouth against Stu\u2019s shoulder.\n\nStu keeps thrusting against Vic\u2019s most sensitive spot and then losing it again, finding it and losing it, and in a way Vic likes it, likes knowing that Stu is caught up and thinking about himself. Eventually it\u2019s not enough, and he grabs Stu\u2019s hand and guides it to his cock, and Stu starts guiltily, like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019d forgotten.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Vic promises, and Stu smiles at him, grateful and with such a gentle expression on his face that Vic has to look away.\n\nTurns out a hand on his cock is all he needs, and pretty soon he\u2019s writhing under Stu, breathing as heavily as if he were in the middle of a foot chase. He can feel tension growing in his stomach, then his legs, then, frustratingly, in his neck and the muscles of his face.\n\nStu presses down hard, brushes his mouth against Vic\u2019s ear, and of course that\u2019s not what does it or anything, but that is the moment the tension finally breaks. Vic convulses wildly, wrapping his arms around Stu, digging his nails in, needing that stability.\n\nHe feels himself come onto Stu\u2019s stomach, sensation breaking over him in long waves, until finally he settles sleepily with one leg still loose around Stu\u2019s waist and the other dangling to the floor.\n\nStu is still hard inside him, and when Vic opens his eyes Stu is watching him, tender and still.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2014\u201c Vic starts, but Stu is already pulling out. Vic groans, and for a moment could almost imagine going again. But Stu wraps a hand around himself, bracing against Vic\u2019s chest with the other, and begins steadily jerking himself off.\n\nIn my mouth next time, Vic thinks, and then is overcome with such desire and fear he has to remind himself to breathe slowly.\n\nStu stares straight into Vic\u2019s eyes the whole time, and that\u2019s a kind of bravery Vic hadn\u2019t even considered up to this point. Pretty soon Stu is panting too, looking broken wide open; Vic watches him come between them too, adding to the mess on Vic\u2019s stomach.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Vic says.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stu says drowsily. He looks at the Vic\u2019s stomach, rising and falling more evenly now. \u201cAw, man! Don\u2019t move.\u201d\n\n\u201cGimme a break,\u201d Vic says, but he stays still while Stu finds a tissue in the backseat organizer and gently wipes Vic clean.\n\n\u201cVic\u2026\u201d Stu says, and fuck his life, here it comes. \u201cI just need to know, is this\u2013\u2013\u201d\n\nFrom somewhere on the floor, Stu\u2019s phone pings. He frowns. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, grappling for it. He glances at the screen, and then back at Vic, face contorted like he\u2019s halfway between laughter and exasperation. \u201cDid you call\u2013\u2013is this an Uber pool?\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be the one to know that?\u201d Vic says, immediately halfway to the defensive. \u201cWhy\u2019s it still going?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, something distracted me but I guess that\u2019s my own fault.\u201d Stu snorts. \u201cI can just decline it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d There\u2019s a chance to get out of here without having a talk, and Vic is gonna jump on it. He sits up and starts pulling his pants back up. \u201cDrop me at any bar, she won\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019ll smell it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCrack a window.\u201d Vic pops the door open and walks around to the passenger seat, letting himself in and buckling up. He can be good too.\n\nStu is following his lead, pulling his shirt over his head and clambering back across the console into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cJust saying, it is a little weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need the cash, right? What\u2019s wrong with the cycling thing, anyway, you burn all your money on modern art and fair trade coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put a lot into it, it\u2019s not gonna turn a profit right away,\u201d Stu mutters, pulling his own seat belt around himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Vic tells him. \u201cI\u2019ll hand out the in-flight snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cNaw.\u201d Stu gives him a half smile. \u201cTurns out people rate you higher when you leave them alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot surprised.\u201d\n\nStu checks his mirrors and puts the car into gear. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I expect anything less than five stars from you, though,\u201d he says, looking over his shoulder.\n\nVic pulls out his phone and grants the requested rating with exaggerated movements.

All of this discourse is EXACTLY what Massive wants. They want the player base to be fragmented because when we unite, we're way too much for them to handle. Because united, the players all affect their bottom line. When we deflect from the MAIN issue (re: Divsion 2 gameplay, ergonomics, and quality of life sucks) Massive gets to quietly take their sweet time working on these \"known issues\" and make a joke out of its customers (us).\n\nI don't need to list the issues we've seen. There are hundreds upon hundreds of posts on the forums, on this subreddit, in their customer service ticket line. We want them to fix the hive bug? Fix Black/White Tusk doing WAY absurd DPS? Fix Green Gear talents? Fix shit exotics? Fix piss poor RNG rolls? Fix lazy programming and game design? Hate how a cover-based game constantly kicks you out of cover, or doesn't let you use cover because of shitty AI mechanics?\n\nStop playing the game.\n\nWe give them so much money because of HOPE. HOPE that they do a better job. HOPE that they fix their game to our liking. HOPE that they fix all the bugs, quickly, professionally, at a high standard of quality. This hope is gone now. There is no more hoping anymore. Now is the time to do. Now is the time the player base needs to unite and demand our money's worth. I can list off reasons why I still play the game, why you play the game, but at the end of the day, you, me, everyone who plays this game we can all agree on one thing: things can be better, we want better, we deserve better, YOU deserve better.\n\nIf you're the general population, YOU work hard for YOUR money. Undoubtedly. YOU go to work for 8+ hours, YOU put up with bullshit customers, managers, bosses, red tape, bureaucracy, Karen's workplace drama, or even all of the above. Your time is worth money. You are worth money. You have value. Anyone and everyone with a sense of reason or logic can agree to this. You are worth what you decide your time is worth.\n\nAt this point, unfortunately, Massive and their devs have unanimously determined that their end content, their higher tiered gameplay, and their overall game, is not worth their time, our time, or our money. Even the devs played the game on \"Normal\" while filming SotG playing polarization and said it was fun, think about that for a second.\n\nSo at this point, before you start typing, before you hit that \"Continue\" button on the Division 2 log-in screen, before you do ANYTHING, think about this for a second, \"Is it worth my time, emotional, physical, and mental energy to continue participating in my own abuse?\"\n\nI'm not asking you to stop playing forever, but stop playing for now. For if/when they address AND FIX these issues. They want to show us they care? Now is the time to do it. How they respond to all their loyal customers leaving will determine whether they care about you or not. People who constantly say Massive doesn't care or people who sing the opposite? This will let them PROVE IT. banned or unbanned. like or dislike the game. DPS glitched or not. This game is fucked if we keep fighting with each other. We need to fight Massive, because THEY'RE the ones who built this game, THEY have the power to change it, THEY have the power to provide us with Quality Assurance in every sense of that concept.\n\nStand with me. We're all customers to them. But we're all gamers to each other. Together we can actually change this game and make it something worth playing. Worth sharing. Worth fighting for. United, we are strong, and they will listen. Fragmented, we only play ourselves. Divided, we only fight ourselves. Segregated, then Massive wins. Continue hoping for a lost cause. You've earned your money, make them earn theirs.\n\nLet's make a deal devs &amp; Massive. You say you \"read and closely monitor the forums and subreddits\" (literal quote from SotG), then let's make a deal. Your player base will deliver on the promise to stop playing this game for now. We'll come back when you deliver on your promises to fix your game AND provide us with the assurance that it is quality.\n\nPublic Service Announcement: because of the pandemic, there are tons of other games out there on sale, for free, not made by Ubisoft of Massive. Go check them out. Hell, go read a book. Get some extra sleep. Hug your loved ones and tell them you love them. Do anything but this, the game as it is, is not worth YOUR TIME.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fstobw/did_you_get_banned_gamers_rise_up_the_division_2/"}, {"title": "Listen here", "content": "Listen here you toe-eyed cabbage, i wasn't born into this world so your fat ass could choke out lo level insults at me.

After all, you know me to be a pretty pragmatic person, and so- before this calamity struck us all- I spent much of my time and money investing in- stockpiling provisions. Not provisions for my belly, but provisions for my eyes, and for my mind, in the form of 3D Blu-rays, Okay? And as you can see now that has paid off in spades. Because I have amassed one of the largest, most comprehensive, and superior collections in this or any other universe. However, before this calamity struck us all, I- much like most of you- found myself so busy in my day-to-day activity, that I hardly had any time to appreciate and indulge myself in my beloved hobby. So, now, I make it a point at least once a day to peruse my collection in order to raise my joy. I will simply run my fingers along the spines of these cinematic masterpieces, arriving at a randomly chosen picture- ah, Skyscraper 3D. There is is. It says right here, starring Dwayne Johnson. Now, allow me to evaluate this cover for you, okay? I'm gonna have to ding them, i'm gonna ding them alittle bit on the cover. I feel like they got the cover art right, the image is right, here you see the Rock hanging off the skyscraper, the city far below him. But it makes you wonder; why couldn't Universal have loosened their purse strings- spent the little extra dough in order to get the holographic lenticular cover. Wouldn't that have been a more powerful effect? If you would see the bulging Johnson hanging from the building, high above the looming city below? I think that would have been abit more powerful. However I do have to give them points for this little feature right here; here it is, emblazoned right on the cover, over 30 minutes of explosive bonus features. Which I like, i'm a fan of bonus features, okay? And what I like that they've done here, is they didn't put this on with an easy-peal sticker. This is actually printed on the cover, so, there will be no removing this, okay? This will be on this cover long after you and I have left this Earth, okay? And, uh, I like that, I like the permanence of it. So, out of five stars, I give it 3 stars overall for the cover. It's a pretty nice design, but alittle bit of a missed opportunity. As for the movie itself? I don't remember it too well, I was kinda in and out of consciousness when I was viewing it. I remember waking up on my couch several times and being surrounded by glowing embers, beautiful red embers floating in the air all around me. It must have been a scene with alot of fire in it, and for that reason I liked it, and for that reason I highly recommend it. This is a good picture, okay? So, that's all for now, here I am, rat-holed in my hobble, with my collection of 3-day- uh, 3D Blu-rays to keep me company.

I was asked several months ago by my editor to do a piece on the so-called 'shitpost' community on Facebook that seems to become more and more popular by the day.\n\nInitially, I was intrigued. The humor was bizarre, yet interesting. Nonsensical, yet genius. I spent several months interacting with people I had never met before in my life, learning the culture, what was \"cool\" and what wasn't. Eventually, I began to make my own posts, testing the waters now and then. And eventually my own posts started getting noticed, and maybe for a minute or two I understood why you all do this. But that didn't last long. And with time, I began to notice how stale the content truly was. How the same 'memes' could be spammed over and over again, and still get massive amounts of attention.\n\nAnd I also began to notice something else. The viciousness with which you attacked each other. The semi-constant bullying and harassment. Each day, it made me even more sickened than before, to the point where you people made me start questioning everything about reality and what I knew about it.\n\nI couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.

Chat had so many inside jokes about it and I had made my share of \"oh man that would be so hot for watching me cry and jerk off\" type quips.\n\nI'm sad now cause now I have to relive the worst screwup of my life. I had been faithfully watching her for almost a year and she mostly played League and Hearthstone plus sandboxy fun games like Little Big Planet and Minecraft. Those games weren't really my cup of tea put her personality and sense of humor were so great that I didn't care.\n\nShe only had about 60 average viewers but we all adored her and there was a great sense of community among everyone. I was super excited that night cause it was her one year twitch anniversary and she invited us all to drink with her to celebrate.\n\nI woke up with a massive hangover still in front of the computer and instantly went to her twitch page to check out the vod and was met with a \"this account does not exist or has been deleted message.\" I'm not proud but my first thought was hoping that she had gotten a bit to flirty in her drunken state and maybe even flashed chat which led to a temporary ban from twitch, I then went to her twitter and her last tweet was \"I'm sorry, I just can't even...I'm out.\" I started to replay the night back in my head and noticed one of my \"hidden\" folders was open and ohhh no..oh god no...\n\nThe night started out great, with many toasts to her subs and longtime lurkers but as she drank more she gradually got more and more morose and started to open up about her personal life. She said she loved streaming but she wanted to do this as a career and her parents had given her a year to prove it was viable until she needed to get a \"real job\" and her time was pretty much up and she was scared. She also talked about how she was undateable (very untrue!) and no man would ever want her. All she really wanted out of life other than making it as a streamer was to be a housewife and mother but she would probably screw that up too, fuck my life!! And she tilted the webcam away so we couldnt see her cry.\n\nI was drinking shots of whiskey to her swigs of champagne and was even drunker than her at this point, and typed \"Actually you'd be an amazing mother!!!\" And I then uploaded a shota gallery of her and me I had been working on for 6 months to imgur and being a longtime mod I was able to link it directly in chat.\n\nI'm a cartoon storyboard artist by trade and had put more effort into this than my real job. In between the sex parts it was full of inside jokes from the stream including the ceiling mirror and the storyline was basically \"me coming home from school and walking in on mom in the shower\" which should be familiar to anyone familiar with the \"genre.\" It even involved several personal aspects of her life I had discovered from a bit of internet detective work.\n\nSeeing the look of horror dawn on her face as she scrolled in disbelief I immediately started apologizing but she ended the stream and I screamed fuck!!! and punched a hole in the wall and started chugging the whiskey in an effort to forget what I did and soon passed out.\n\nIt's been 3 months and she hasn't come back, the only saving grace is I deleted the gallery before passing out and nothing made it onto r/cringe or livestreamfails.

mine craft was intended for.\u00a0 the buckets are girly.\u00a0 it's like if a miner walked around in a cave with a 'pretty metal bucket'.\u00a0 I think the girls kind of messed up minecraft.\u00a0

they don't build anything.\u00a0 all they give you is fish meat they need to give you dolphin meat.\u00a0 maybe an ender pearl.\n\nminecraft should be more about constant bombardment of mobs and the endermen should be more invadeing and like destroy all your creations constantly.\u00a0 like sometimes ridiculously.\u00a0 like in the air and they send the creepers.\u00a0 sometimes your whole map get erassed and it's called the nuke.\u00a0\n\nyou should have to pay to use dimonds in minecraft.\u00a0 and it would be more about makeing jewlry and stuff but that be for a girl.\u00a0 the minecraft

out the hat. because they didn't have those hats back then.\u00a0 and it should be that your a peasant farming not an actuall like you build the houses.\u00a0\n\nIt should be more of a bad cheap knock off of zelda but it's dark link and he doesn't have a hat and your a peasant farming and the mobs are constant bombardment. and you have to send your farmed food to the kingdom.\u00a0 and there still is red stone though but more spicific and also more realistic.\u00a0 but like actually how electricity works and it's like wires.\u00a0 and you have to solder and everything and you can make minecraft in minecraft.\u00a0\n\nThe bees were kind of for a girl too. so please take them out.\u00a0 it should be that in vanilla minecraft you play with the bees but in minecraft java it's more about mindless constant mineing like just a solid massive block of one type of rock.\u00a0 and then you would get three coal. maybe it's less about useing a pick axe because that's not how they really mine and more of you have to use trucks and stuff and you mine massive amounts and just get like 3 dust.\u00a0\n\nand you should have to choose your actuall profession like either farmer or mob fighter or miner. so if you want to mine you would pick miner but then you wouldn't do much farming.\u00a0\n\nand it shouldn't be about actuall mineing it should be a war simulator.\u00a0 bassically all the video games are really just call of duty if you think about it so wouldn't it just be call of duty.\u00a0 but then whats the point of minecraft is that it's just cheaper graphics.\u00a0 so like block graphics with call of duty style game play.\u00a0 maybe your sword is a mealy weapon like the knife in call of duty but your gun is a bow and arrow.\n\nI don't mean to sterotype or something but girls ruined warhammer.\u00a0 they made the space marines like a girls army.\u00a0 the recent update.\u00a0 and i think it's great that girls are getting into minecraft and warhammer but they need to have protocalls to make sure that girls don't make these franchises like a girl's game like aneta sarckeshien.\u00a0 is zelda isn't a game about linkle it's about link cause otherwise what's the point of zelda is it's just a bunch of random midevial stuff like all the other games. so minecraft is like a game spicifcally about steeve the miner but he needs to actually be dressed as a miner. but it wouldn't make sense that it was steeve steeve would be like the farmer. but the game would be about dark link with out his hat.\u00a0 but he gets other armor like in breath of the wild. so it's not link.\n\nwhen you make a video game you have to say what time period it is ?\u00a0 is it the future or call of duty or the mediveal ages?\u00a0 so you wanted to make a game about the midevial ages so it basically just be zelda but they allready made that game.\u00a0 so you have to make your own characters.\u00a0 and so it be a different princess and it would basically be a dark link without a hat with breath of the wild armor and then the sheild from minecraft and a stone axe.\u00a0 but he uses dinomite. but then it's just about that character because why does minecraft have all these characters?\u00a0\n\nand it wouldn't be minecarts it would just be a train and it like loads you into the differnet maps like in minecraft the minecart wasnt that spicific.\u00a0 cause what's the point of minecraft?\u00a0 is that tetris is a puzzle game. and all the other games are basically just call of duty if you think about it so like zelda was like the earlier type of call of duty but now they have gun game mechanics so he would basically get a gun after a while.\u00a0 or a sling shot basically.\u00a0 and so then minecraft would be zelda then but they allready made zelda the video game.\u00a0\n\nand the physics should be fixed like the redstone would just be wires. but you can use the dust too. but like the minecart wouldn't be like a cheap un finished box that i know you guys haven't actually figured out completly yet.\u00a0 so it be a train then.\u00a0 but that just be roller coaster tycoon.\u00a0 and they need to have like things like engines but you have to build the engines and you can make minecraft in minecraft and then hellicopters.\n\nall the dimond stuff should be taken out.\u00a0 like even books.\u00a0 because it isn't an actuall book.\u00a0 if you want to read go pick up a book seperatly. but why would you read a book in a video game.\u00a0 it would just be point and shoot.\n\nand it isn't difficult enough.\u00a0 it would be basically constant bombardment of dungeons to explore but then why does the map automatically generate?\u00a0 so basically it should just be like 12 levels like in call of duty and it would be like \"dude have you played minecraft medieval conflict tales of the princess minecraft lady 3\".\n\nand you should pick an actuall minecraft flag and take out the flags in minecraft like basically you can only make the 20 different countries anyways so basically it would be like you use coins like on ps4 store and physally have to purchase a flag or basically it would just be a poster but the game allready has a flag.\u00a0\n\nand also that there aren't any ships.\u00a0 most of the map would just be water.\u00a0 and the game would be like 12 or 8 levels and then one big map like in an actuall game and that's like the main objective map that goes to the different other dungeons.\u00a0 and there isn't any other worlds.\u00a0 you should decide now that you made the different biomes what the biome is for the whole game.\u00a0 but if you want to make another biome that would be a sequal and wouldn't be the actuall different world.\u00a0", "link":
