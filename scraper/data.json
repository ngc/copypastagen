As well as a 90K 11520x16000 resolution monitor with 8000000000000000hz refresh rate. Not to mention, 950000000000TB of storage, 750 Trillion-Gigawatts of power supply, and a motherboard forged through an ancient Mongolian technique originating from 7th century B.C, passed on to strictly one generation of blacksmith at a time. The process begins by scourging the Eurasian Steppes for a specific type of silicon ore. The name of this material is too complex to be translated to English, and I fear that if I told you the name, it would be lethally ravaging to your feeble virgin mind. But for the sake of reference, we will roughly translate this material to \u201cKhamag Yurmumgei.\u201d Once Yurmumgei is acquired, the material must be transported to the blacksmith and forged within 32 hours, otherwise the material will begin leaking corruption which will ultimately result in the demise of the multiverse. After delivering the Yurmumgei, he who had delivered it must immediately commit suicide. Otherwise the ore will begin to gain malevolent sentience and start attacking everyone in the vicinity. It is said that by commiting suicide, the spirit leaves the corpse and is then consumed by the Yurmumgei ore, leaving it content and willing to be smelted. Once smelted, it can freely be forged as one pleases. For my motherboard, a Chinese sweatshop laborer volunteered to mine Yurmumgei ore for the sweet release of death. That\u2019s right, someone died for my motherboard. He probably had more worth than you. That\u2019s how expensive it is. To add more insult to your injury, I\u2019ve had my motherboard reinforced with black widow spider silk, soaked in 6 billion dollar Silician Malvasia Wine, and coated with Swiss thermal paste consisting of gooseberries and quail saliva. My peripherals include a 48-karat gold DVORAK keyboard and a 99999 carat-diamond mouse. My PC case was hand painted by Leonardo DaVinci himself.

There is no question about this, it is repeatedly demonstrated that Mr. Krabs is a cruel boss, pathetically obsessed with money even at the expense of his own health (\u201cSquid's Day Off\u201d). He has attempted to charge his workers for breathing (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d), forced them to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (\u201cGraveyard Shift\u201d) and even traded Spongebob's soul for a measly 62 cents (\u201cBorn Again Krabs\u201d). His continual protection of the Krabby Patty Secret Formula from Plankton, in which he enlists the involuntary help of Spongebob (who sees it as a valiant quest to protect the honor of the Krusty Krab) and Squidward (who is just in it for the paycheck), is nothing more than a cheap quest to protect the profit margin of the Krabby Patty, which he likely sells for more than it is worth. There are two ways his workers can react to this awful situation, and Spongebob and Squidward each represent one of them. Squidward is the class-conscious worker. He is fully aware of his miserable situation under the thumb of Mr. Krabs, thus resulting in his depressed and irritable attitude. He is clearly no stranger to Marxist ideas, being the only one of the two to quit due to Krabs' abuse (\u201cCan You Spare a Dime?\u201d) and starting a strike against Mr. Krabs (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d). He finds solace in art, and dreams of living in a utopian Fully Automated Luxury Communism, relaxing while making his art and sharing it with the world. It was Oscar Wilde, after all, who argued in The Soul of Man Under Socialism that only when their needs are fully accounted for can the artist truly hone their creative genius. He is continually disappointed with his fellow proletarians, the denizens of Bikini Bottom, most of all Spongebob.\n\nIf one thinks about it, Squidward really has no apparent reason to hate Spongebob. Spongebob is incredibly kind to Squidward, giving him gifts, saying good morning to him every day, altogether just trying to bring joy into Squidward's life. We are led to believe that Squidward is simply a curmudgeon who hates Spongebob for being happy while he is depressed. But is that really as deep as it goes? I think not. Once one realizes the Marxist undertones in Spongebob, the answer is clear: Squidward resents Spongebob because he is not class-conscious.\n\nDespite his miserable working conditions, despite his boss's abusive behavior, Spongebob remains relentlessly optimistic. A classic case of the unconscious worker. He is cheerful and optimistic about his condition because he is unaware of anything beyond it. He has a Stockholm Syndrome-esque relationship with his boss, seeing him as a father figure (a classic symptom of blind obedience to authority) and enduring humiliating treatment because he holds on to the promise of one day owning the Krusty Krab, thus taking Krabs' place as the new Bourgeois. Given that he does not even know what a Strike is (\u201cSquid on Strike\u201d) it is clear that he has never been exposed to the Marxist critique. In this context, Squidward represents the ill fate of the worker who does not respect his fellow worker. His attempt at revolution fails because he does not respect Spongebob, and simply tried to use him as a pawn for his own ends. But I digress.\n\nPatrick represents what Marx called the Lumpenproletariat. Unemployed, he is left out of the class struggle, and even if he were involved in it would be too stupid to do anything, as symbolized in his attempt at employment in \u201cBig Pink Loser\u201d. However his value to Squidward, the class-conscious worker who hopes for revolution, is underrated. Marxists from Bakunin onward have criticized Marx's rejection of the lumpenproletariat, and Stephen Hillenburg is no exception. Patrick clearly has the socialist spirit in him, recognizing the value of idleness and enjoying life's simple pleasures. Patrick never seeks after money or power as the Bourgeois expects him to, he simply wants to live out his life in peace. He values friendship over all things; he once admitted to spending all day waiting for his best friend, Spongebob, to come back (\u201cNew Student Starfish\u201d). Could this represent how industrial work gets in the way of social bonds? Possibly. The point, my friend, is that Patrick in his idle lumpen state has captured the same optimism and joie de vivre of Spongebob. It could be said that the only difference between him and Spongebob is that Spongebob has subsumed to industrial work. In this way, he is the proletarian who is conscious of Socialist ideas without even knowing it.\n\nSandy and Plankton represent two possibilities of the future in Marxist analysis. Both of them are clearly college-educated scientists whose approach to technology differs based on their position towards Capitalism. Plankton represents the dystopian Capitalist future, the future of Cyberspace where companies like the Chum Bucket control society (remember that Plankton's expressed goal is to \u201ctake over the world\u201d). He represents a cold, distant, inhuman, industrial future, as symbolized by the cold metal interior of the Chum Bucket.\n\nSandy, on the other hand, seems as well-versed in technology as Plankton, but has used it for a completely different purpose. She has created the treedome, an ecological, self-sustaining utopia in which she has everything she needs. She built a rocket to the moon for the sole purpose of exploration (\u201cSandy's Rocket\u201d). She pursues science out of pure wonder and a desire for the fulfillment of knowledge, unlike Plankton who pursues science out of a desire for domination and control. She represents Fully Automated Luxury Communism, a utopia in which everyone has everything they need and are free to pursue their passions without the burden of work.\n\nFinally, we have Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff was a hard one, but I think she represents the failure and uselessness of modern education. She continually attempts to teach Spongebob a useless skill (he walks to work, he doesn't need to drive) for a pathetic trinket of authority (his driver's license, whose possibility of attainment he worships).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/fsggc0/the_main_characters_in_spongebob_are_marxist/"}, {"title": "Hentai be like", "content": "B-be my dicky daddy!

You will not stand in the way of a movement that aims to liberate the populace, so all can live warmly with roofs over their heads. You will ensure that our precious tax dollars don\u2019t evict another soul on this soil. You will ensure that the right for safe and secure survival trumps the right for extortion and eviction. You can be sure that we will fight until that is ensured. No landlord will see a dollar in rent income up until and thereafter all have safe and secure dwellings. \n\nThere is no compromise. We have more homes than people, and we have more living units in homes than houses. There is no compromise. The greed of a few do not outweigh the rights of the many. There is no compromise. A leader is for the people, and you who protect rent-seeker profits over the populace, betrayed the people!\n\n\u2018What about him and what about her and what about them\u2019 they will say, as they refer to the fortunate who will lose few over the misfortunate who stand to lose it all. All can have roofs over their heads. Just not at one\u2019s cost and the other\u2019s parasitic benefit. Eviction need not happen. \n\n\u2018But who will build the homes and who will buy them?\u2019 the builders will build for the roof-seekers that seek bigger roofs. We have more homes than people, and more living units in homes than houses. \n\n\u2018But truly, the rental property owners do good work!\u2019 When they plumb they do good work. When they paint they do good work. When they carpent and configure wires they do good work. But where is the good work in ownership? Surely there is a large workforce of the good work, and an unnecessary own-force of the lack thereof. \n\n\u2018You are lazy, expecting to not work and get things for free. You are nothing but an entitled grout!\u2019, yet they do not respond this way when one needs food or water. Yet when one wishes to not be devoured by pests in the summer days, awash with heavy rain in the spring-days, buried in black-frost upon the winter days, and a detrimental mixture of all upon the unlucky fall-days, why do they receive such vitriol? When rent-seekers fill their own pockets to the detriment of roof-seekers, and demand the working taxpayer to protect this right, why do they receive such praise and promise? \n\n\u2018You wish to seize this property through violent force, it is YOU who are in the wrong\u2019 and to that we say \u2018you wish to remove a roof-seeker from shelter through violent force for your own pockets with my hard-earned labour-fruits. I self-preserve as much as you do. Right and wrong absent of humanity is sociopathic conjecture. To such conjectures, it is right and necessary to be wrong!\u2019\n\nTo the important person this is sent to, you understand what is at stake here. It took an earthly rumbling to make cracks of golden light on the black concrete. The people will strike, and you who are for the people, will ensure their demands are seen. A world where all men are created equal. A world where all have maximized life, liberty, and paths to happiness. You took on the role of public servant for none other than this goal. We the people fought for none other than this goal. The first step, on April 1st and beyond, is to ensure not another soul on this soil gets evicted.

But the show has the AUDACITY to begin with them at the Wall, going north?! This show clearly has absolutely ZERO respect for the source material if they're going to make such a massive deviation from the source material so soon in the series. I am more disgusted than I've ever been in my life. I've already destroyed the season 1 dvds and sent hitmen after the former showrunners. Every time I think about what could've been had they started the show with the Night's Watchmen already north of the Wall, I go into a blinding rage and destroy everything in sight.

Well apparently there are a select few contexts within which such an action is acceptable. For instance, if your niece has a hacking cough and your sister asks you to \"put some of this on her\" while she calls the doctor. \"Putting some of this on her\" meant using my bare hands to rub this vapor ointment shit all over her BARE NAKED CHEST. My heartbeat is still all erratic from it. I had a boner the size of Manhattan the entire time. She's sleeping now and I guess she feels better because she stopped coughing. Details: She's about 5 feet tall, has long brown hair, a cute face, a thin waist and long skinny legs. She's in jammies I think because although I'm pretty shaken up right now I know I unbuttoned something before I went at it. God I feel so great. I just rubbed my hands all over her FUCKING TITS, you guys. Well the puffy parts of her chest anyway. Her nipples got hard. I just about wept tears of joy. I didn't do anything else because I'm a coward and rubbing was enough. Plus it was legal and I didn't technically do anything wrong, so I'm in the clear.

There was my cousin, hovering over me. \"What's wrong?\" I ask. \"I have to leave again.\" He says softly. I tilt my head in confusion. \"Why now? How long with it take?\" He pressed his lips into a thin line. His expression is clouded in the darkness. With sleepy eyes, I gave him my best pout. \"Can't you stay here? I want you to sleep next to me. There's room for you, here.\" I gesture towards the small space next to me.\n\nMy cousin pats my head gently. \"You're so cute,\" he lets out a small laugh and my face widens into a grin. He pulls my head close to his chest. \"But you know I can't,\" he murmurs next to my ear. \"I have a job to do.\" He pulls away quickly. \"Don't go,\" I pleaded. He caresses my cheek with one hand in an attempt to reassure me. It feels rough and tense. With a sad smile, he draws his body away from me.\n\n\"Onii-san!\" I exclaimed, clenching my fists together. Fear ripples through my body. I don't want him to go. He puts a finger to his lips. \"Don't let them know, SARS-chan.
